CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.

In this workshop, you'll learn CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will learn the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) by building a cafe menu.

Start by adding your <!DOCTYPE html> and html element with a lang attribute set to en.

Step 2
Add a head element within the html element, so you can add a title element. The title element's text should be Cafe Menu.

Step 3
Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset set to the value utf-8. This tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.

Step 4 Passed
To prepare to create some actual content, add a body element below the head element.

Step 5 Passed
It's time to add some menu content. Add a main element within the existing body element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.
